Project Overview:
As part of a detailed business analysis project, I transformed raw sales data from Vrinda Store into actionable insights to drive revenue growth. Using Excel, I cleaned, processed, and analysed transactional data to identify key trends, customer behaviour patterns, and operational inefficiencies. The final dashboard provided strategic recommendations to optimize sales and marketing efforts.
